## Customer Churn Prediction

### Project Overview

This project aims to predict customer retention using machine learning models. By identifying patterns in customer behavior, businesses can implement strategies to reduce churn and improve customer loyalty.

### Steps

1. **Data Collection**
   - **Description**: Gather data from reliable sources. This includes customer demographics, transaction history, and service usage patterns.
   - **Tools**: Pandas for data manipulation.

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - **Description**: Clean and prepare the dataset. Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize numerical features.
   - **Tools**: Pandas, Scikit-learn.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - **Description**: Analyze the dataset to understand correlations and patterns. Use visualizations to gain insights into key factors affecting churn.
   - **Tools**: Matplotlib, Seaborn.

4. **Feature Engineering**
   - **Description**: Create new features that can enhance model performance. Consider interaction terms or derived metrics that capture customer behavior more effectively.
   - **Tools**: Pandas.

5. **Model Selection**
   - **Description**: Choose suitable machine learning models, such as logistic regression, decision trees, or random forests, for predicting churn.
   - **Tools**: Scikit-learn.

6. **Model Training**
   - **Description**: Split the data into training and testing sets. Train the chosen models on the training data.
   - **Tools**: Scikit-learn.

7. **Model Evaluation**
   - **Description**: Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Use cross-validation for robust assessment.
   - **Tools**: Scikit-learn.

8. **Hyperparameter Tuning**
   - **Description**: Optimize model parameters to improve accuracy and generalization.
   - **Tools**: Scikit-learn's GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.

9. **Model Deployment**
   - **Description**: Prepare the model for deployment in a production environment. This involves saving the model and creating an API for predictions.
   - **Tools**: Flask for API development, joblib for model serialization.

10. **Conclusion and Insights**
    - **Description**: Summarize the findings and suggest actionable insights for reducing churn based on model predictions.
